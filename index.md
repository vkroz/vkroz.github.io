# Vladimir Kroz

I build AI systems and the infrastructure that keeps them alive in production. Over the past decade I've done this at Amazon and across enterprise and growth-stage companies — ML platforms, agentic systems, vector search, FinOps tooling.

This blog is a working notebook. I write when I have something concrete to say — a decision I had to make, a system I built, or a pattern I've seen fail in production.
